<b>VULNERABILITY DETAILS</b>
V8 caps the number of elements a fixed array can contain[1]. Most of the code that needs to create
or resize a fast JS array (i.e. one that's backed by a fixed array rather than a dictionary) ends up
calling either the regular C++ function `AllocateRawFixedArray`[2] or its CSA equivalent
`AllocateFixedArray`[3]. Both functions validate the length parameter and terminate the execution
when the upper limit is exceeded.

Recently, the same operation has been implemented in Torque. The newly introduced functions
`NewFixedArray` and `NewFixedDoubleArray`, however, lack a similar length check:

```
macro NewFixedArray<Iterator: type>(length: intptr, it: Iterator): FixedArray {
  if (length == 0) return kEmptyFixedArray;
  return new
  FixedArray{map: kFixedArrayMap, length: Convert<Smi>(length), objects: ...it};
}

macro NewFixedDoubleArray<Iterator: type>(
    length: intptr, it: Iterator): FixedDoubleArray|EmptyFixedArray {
  if (length == 0) return kEmptyFixedArray;
  return new FixedDoubleArray{
    map: kFixedDoubleArrayMap,
    length: Convert<Smi>(length),
    floats: ...it
  };
}
```

I've discovered two (indirect) users of `NewFixedArray` that can be abused to create an array with
an invalid length. The first one is `ArrayPrototypeSplice`[5]. An attacker can call `splice` to add
extra elements to a fast JS array that's just below the size limit. However, naively appending
elements in a loop in order to obtain such an *enormous but still valid* array would fail and
trigger an out-of-memory crash. A possible (and really quick) alternative is to merge a smaller
array with itself several times:

```
array = Array(0x80000).fill(1);
array.prop = 1;
args = Array(0x100 - 1).fill(array);
args.push(Array(0x80000 - 4).fill(2));
giant_array = Array.prototype.concat.apply([], args);
giant_array.splice(giant_array.length, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3);
```

Another function that transitively calls `NewFixedArray` is `RegExpPrototypeMatch`[6]. In this case,
no preliminary array manipulation is required, although it's significantly slower:

```
giant_array = /a/g[Symbol.match]('a'.repeat(0x8000000));
```

The attacker can exploit this issue to confuse TurboFan's typer about the possible range of the
length property of a fast JS array and use the confusion to bypass security checks, similarly to,
for example, https://crbug.com/1051017. Unfortunately, the bounds check elimination technique from
previous exploits is still viable due to a bug in one the hardening patches[7] for the typer:

```
Reduction TypedOptimization::ReduceMaybeGrowFastElements(Node* node) {
[...]
  if (!index_type.IsNone() && !length_type.IsNone() &&
      index_type.Max() < length_type.Min()) {
    Node* check_bounds = graph()->NewNode(
        simplified()->CheckBounds(FeedbackSource{},
                                  CheckBoundsFlag::kAbortOnOutOfBounds),
        index, length, effect, control);
    ReplaceWithValue(node, elements);
    return Replace(check_bounds);
  }

  return NoChange();
}
```

The patch adds a `CheckBounds` node to prevent OOB write access when the typer incorrectly assumes
that a given array will never have to be extended. The problem is that the new node has no output
edges: by the time `Replace` is called, the original node's effect edge has been already modified by
`ReplaceWithValue`, and the value output from the `CheckBounds` node is never used. Therefore, the
new node always gets eliminated in one of the subsequent optimization passes.

There's also another `CheckBounds` node that verifies the array index is less than `length + 1024`,
so the attacker has to employ the OOB access to overwrite data located relatively close to the
array. A good candidate, which immediately presents a powerful exploitation primitive, is the length
field of another fast array.
